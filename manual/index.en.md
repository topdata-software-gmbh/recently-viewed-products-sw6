The "Recently Viewed Products" plugin enhances your storefront by displaying a slider with products that a customer has recently viewed. This powerful marketing tool helps remind customers of products they were interested in, increasing the likelihood of a purchase.

The plugin offers extensive configuration options, allowing you to control where and how the sliders appear. You can automatically add a slider to all product detail pages and other CMS pages, or you can manually place and customize individual sliders using the Shopping Experiences editor.
