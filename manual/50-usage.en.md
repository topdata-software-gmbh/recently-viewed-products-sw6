Beyond the automatic placement configured in the settings, the plugin's main feature is its integration with Shopware's **Shopping Experiences**. This allows you to place a recently viewed products slider on any CMS layout you create.

### Adding the Slider to a CMS Page

1.  Navigate to **Content > Shopping Experiences** in the Shopware Admin.
2.  Open an existing layout or create a new one.
3.  Click the `+` icon to add a new block.
4.  In the block selection menu, choose the **Commerce** category.
5.  Drag and drop the **Recently viewed products slider** block onto your layout.

### Configuring the Slider Element

Once you have added the block, the "Recently Viewed Product Slider" element will be inside it. Click on the element to open its settings in the right-hand sidebar.

Here, you can override all the default settings that were defined in the plugin configuration. This allows you to customize each slider individually to match the design of a specific page.

The available settings include:

*   Slider title
*   Display Mode
*   Vertical Align
*   Navigation
*   And all other visual options.

When you are finished, click **Save** to apply your changes to the layout.
